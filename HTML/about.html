        <h2>The Sugarland Cafe</h2>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>The Sugarland Cafe</strong>!
            Here we are the premier food provider of the Sugarland Campus.<img src="images/college_dining.jpg"
                alt="college_dining" align="right"> <br>
            I opened this Cafe because when I was a student here I believed
            that chips and coffee were not enough <br>food options to feed the nurses,
            technology, and Wharton County Junior College students. <br>
            You must be wondering, "That's all well and good but, who am I?"<br></p>
        <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
        <p>Hi, my name is Matt, a student at the University of Houston Cullen College of Engineering.
            <br> I opened this cafe to provide myself and others with the proper nutrients <img src="images/owner.jpg"
                alt="owner" align="right"><br>
            to lead a healthy lifestyle.<br>
        </p>
